## What is tracker?

`P2P Media Loader` uses WebTorrent compatible trackers to do [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) signaling - exchanging [SDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol) data between peers to connect them into a swarm.

Few [public trackers](https://openwebtorrent.com/) are configured in the library by default for easy development and testing but [don't use public trackers in production](#dont-use-public-trackers-in-production).

Any compatible WebTorrent tracker works for `P2P Media Loader`:

- [Aquatic](https://github.com/greatest-ape/aquatic) - A high-performance BitTorrent tracker written in Rust.
- [wt-tracker](https://github.com/Novage/wt-tracker) - high-performance WebTorrent tracker by Novage that uses [uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) for I/O.
- [bittorrent-tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker) - tracker from WebTorrent project that uses Node.js I/O

## Don't use public trackers in production

[Public trackers](https://openwebtorrent.com/) allow quickly begin development and testing of P2P technologies on the web.
But they support a limited number of peers and can reject connections or even go down on a heavy loads.

That is why they can't be used in production environments. Consider running your personal tracker or buy resources from a tracker provider to go stable.

## What are the requirements to share a stream over P2P?

The requirements to share a stream over P2P are:

- The stream should have the same swarm ID on all the peers. Swarm ID is equal to the stream manifest URL without query parameters by default. If a stream URL is not the same for different peers you can set the swarm ID manually [using configuration](#how-to-manually-set-swarm-id).
- The manifest should have the same number of variants (i.e. qualities) in the same order on all the peers. URLs of the variant playlists don't matter.
- Variants should consist of the same segments under the same sequence numbers (see #EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE for HLS) on all the peers. URLs of the segments don't matter.

## Is it possible to have 100% P2P ratio?

It is possible for a single peer but not possible for a swarm of peers in total.

P2P Media Loader implements approach of P2P assisted video delivery. It means that the stream should be downloaded via HTTP(S) at least once to be shared between peers in a swarm.

For example for 10 peers in the best case the maximum possible P2P ratio is 90% if a stream was downloaded from the source only once.

## What happens if there are no peers on a stream?

P2P Media Loader downloads all the segments from HTTP(S) source in this case. It should not perform worse than a player configured without P2P at all.

## How to configure personal tracker and STUN servers?

```javascript
const config = {
  core: {
    announceTrackers: [
      "wss://personal.tracker1.com",
      "wss://personal.tracker2.com",
    ],
    rtcConfig: {
      iceServers: [
        { urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
        { urls: "stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp" },
      ],
    },
  },
};

const engineShaka = new ShakaP2PEngine(config, shaka);
// or
const engineHlsJs = new HlsJsP2PEngine(config);
```

```javascript
const HlsWithP2P = HlsJsP2PEngine.injectMixin(Hls);
const hls = new HlsWithP2P({
  p2p: {
    core: {
      announceTrackers: [
        "wss://personal.tracker1.com",
        "wss://personal.tracker2.com",
      ],
      rtcConfig: {
        iceServers: [
          { urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
          { urls: "stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp" },
        ],
      },
    },
    onHlsJsCreated(hls) {
      // Subscribe to P2P engine and Hls.js events here
      hls.p2pEngine.addEventListener("onSegmentLoaded", (details) => {
        console.log("Segment Loaded:", details);
      });
    },
  },
});
```

## How to manually set swarm ID?

```javascript
const config = {
  core: {
    swarmId: "https://somecdn.com/mystream_12345.m3u8", // any unique string
  },
};

const engineShaka = new ShakaP2PEngine(config, shaka);
// or
const engineHlsJs = new HlsJsP2PEngine(config);
```

```javascript
const HlsWithP2P = HlsJsP2PEngine.injectMixin(Hls);
const hls = new HlsWithP2P({
  p2p: {
    core: {
      swarmId: "https://somecdn.com/mystream_12345.m3u8", // any unique string
    },
    onHlsJsCreated(hls) {
      // Subscribe to P2P engine and Hls.js events here
      hls.p2pEngine.addEventListener("onSegmentLoaded", (details) => {
        console.log("Segment Loaded:", details);
      });
    },
  },
});
```

## How to see that P2P is actually working?

The easiest way is to subscribe to P2P [events](https://novage.github.io/p2p-media-loader/docs/v2.0/types/p2p_media_loader_core.CoreEventMap.html) and log them:

```javascript
const engine = new HlsJsP2PEngine();

engine.addEventListener("onSegmentLoaded", (details) => {
  console.log("Segment Loaded:", details);
});
```

```javascript
const HlsWithP2P = HlsJsP2PEngine.injectMixin(Hls);
const hls = new HlsWithP2P({
  p2p: {
    onHlsJsCreated(hls) {
      hls.p2pEngine.addEventListener("onSegmentLoaded", (details) => {
        console.log("Segment Loaded:", details);
      });
    },
  },
});
```

Open few P2P enabled players with the same stream so they can connect.

## How to debug?

To enable ALL debugging type in browser's console `localStorage.debug = 'p2pml-core:*'` and reload the webpage.

To enable specific logs use filtering like `localStorage.debug = 'p2pml-core:peer'`.

Check the source code for all the possible log types.
